## Code convention

### Syntax

- Keep code lines under 80 columns wide.
- Use soft tabs set to 2 spaces.
- Indent lines with tabs instead of spaces.
- Use single quotes.
- Use trailing commas wherever possible, including function parameters and
  calls.
- Print spaces between brackets in object literals.
- Put the > of a multi-line JSX element on the next line.
- Exclude parentheses around a sole arrow function parameter.
- Wrap prose if it exceeds the print width.
- Use semicolons.
- Set off operators with spaces.
- Use braces with all multi-line blocks.
- Place 1 space before the opening parenthesis in control statements (if, while
  etc.). Place no space before the argument list in function calls and
  declarations.

### Style

- Use Sass to keep large stylesheets well-organized.
- Favor rems for relative values, preferably typography.
- Donâ€™t be afraid of using px when you want to exactly define a measure.
- Don't use important.
- Always prefer SVG over raster assets.

  - react;
  - external;
  - index;
  - sibling;
  - parent;
  - internal;
  - builtin;
  - object;
  - type;
  - styles.
